# WebScrap-for-E-commerce

The aim of this project is to scrape product data from an e-commerce website and upload it to Trendyol Marketplace using Trendyol's API service. It takes login information for the specified website and manages cookies across pages. MANDATORY parts are highlighted in caps. This code is specifically designed for the website (https://www.yeninesiltoptanci.com/), so make sure to change the variable names according to your target website. Especially getting Color and Size values were strange and more difficult from average.
